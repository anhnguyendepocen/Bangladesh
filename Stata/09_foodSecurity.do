"In line with WFPâ€™s methodology, the thresholds had to be adjusted considering the oil 
consumption of char dwellers. In Bangladesh, there is a known high consumption of 
edible oil. The FCS thresholds therefore had to be raised by seven points each to 
consider this daily consumption of oil (pp. 2)"
